		<p align="center">I, Pradip Basnet, is a student of Computer Science and Information Technology at Asian School of Management and Technology located at Gongabu Chowk, Kathmandu. I, currently living at Lainchaur, Kathmandu, am a permanent residence of Dharan-23, Sunsari. I was born on 14th August, 1992 to my parents Ramesh Kumar Basnet and Indira Basnet.</p>
		<p align="center"></p> I would like to call myself a passionate lover of music and football. I love to listen to classic rock and love Football Club Barcelona in football. I can't explain about the immense pleasure I get while listening to classic rock or watching FCB play or I should say win. </p>
